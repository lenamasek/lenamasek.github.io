	Manifold Garden, previously known as Relativity, is an exploration-puzzle game that imagines a universe with a different set of physical laws.
	Set in an Escher-esque world filled with secrets and mysteries, you utilize a unique gravity-manipulation mechanic to turn walls into floors. Learn to see the world through whole new perspectives as you navigate mindboggling architecture and solve seemingly impossible puzzles.

	<history>
	 <![CDATA[In November 2012, William Chyr began working on Manifold Garden, initially the project was called Relativity, and it was to be a small project to learn the basics of game development and the Unity3D engine. Drawing inspiration from various physics thought experiments, he created a rough prototype over Thanksgiving weekend. After showing an early version of the game to some playtesters and receiving encouraging feedback, he decided to pursue the idea further and continue development.
	<br /><br />   
	In 2013, Chyr was awarded a six-month artist residency at the Swatch Art Peace Hotel in Shanghai, China. This gave him the opportunity to focus on development of the game full-time and take it to a level that demonstrates many of the core ideas of the project.
	<br /><br />   
	In October 2013, CHyr returned to Chicago, where he has continued to work on <i>Manifold Garden</i> since. ]]>

			<description>The world emulates the black and white minimalism of Escher's work, and the crisp modern design populating the walls, windows, and massive towers seen in the distance inspire a desire to explore. </description>
