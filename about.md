i'm frank, but my name is lena. my full name is celena (read: suh-lee-nuh) – you can call me that but you'd be the only one. i work at [torque](http://torque.digital), a small digital marketing and branding agency in the west loop of chicago. 

at torque, i apply strategic concepts to a variety of media. i do everything from print design and production to web design and development. i also program emails and design app interfaces.

i freelance on the side and would love to work with you on your next project. i have a lot of experience specifically making small websites to promote products and small businesses. however, i'm up for anything. [get in touch](mailto:lena.masek@gmail.com)

outside of work, i enjoy trying new beers and coffees – only the good ones, biking around chicago, going for walks long enough to forget about the human condition, observing comedy to offset the previous, discussing intersectional feminism, numbing my migraines, reading people's opinions in their blog posts, and voicing my own. i'd like to be friends, most of mine are on [twitter](http://twitter.com/lenamasek).
