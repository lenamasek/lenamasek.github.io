i'm frank, but my name is lena. my full name is celena (read: suh-lee-nuh) – you can call me that but you'd be the only one. i work at [torque](http://torque.digital), a small digital marketing and branding agency in the west loop of chicago. 

at torque, i apply strategic concepts to a variety of media. i do everything from print design and production to web design and development. i also program emails and design app interfaces.

i also freelance on the side and would love to work with you on your next project. i have a lot of experience specifically making small websites to promote products and small businesses. however, i'm up for anything. [get in touch](mailto:lena.masek@gmail.com)
