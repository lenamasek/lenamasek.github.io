Over the past year or so at [Torque](http://torque.digital), we've been sharing skills and knowledge in small sessions with each other. We're working toward a consistent workshop schedule, and right now, that looks like a weekly 2:30pm 'tea time' in the conference room.

This week, Partner and Creative Director [Jennifer Masi](http://torque.digital/team/jennifer-masi) taught us all about The Art of Delegating, also known by her actionable phrase, "Delegate to Elevate." I want to share with you a summary of her session, because I believe it's really important. I know too many people who work alone with blinders on, void of collaboration. These people also usually don't have strong skills for teamwork, collaboration, and the ability to trust others, let alone delegate to them. It is scary to invite someone else in to your creative process for fear of making vulnerable your end product – I know from experience – but there are definitely ways to do it well.

### Goals of Delegation
Delegating helps elevate you to your best use and elevates helpers as they learn and grow. Delegating helps you learn to trust others, helps get the job done, and diversifies perspectives going into the project.

### Learn to Delegate 

1. *Give time frame & details* -the more info the better (be specific)
2. *Delegate the objective, not the procedure* (they’ll do it their way)
3. *Ensure your helper has whatever he/she needs to succeed*
4. *Give your helper the opportunity to ask questions*
5. *Ask your helper to confirm completion*
6. *Recognize your helper once the task is complete* (a big thanks goes a long way)
