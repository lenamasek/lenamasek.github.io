Over the past year or so at [Torque](http://torque.digital), we've been sharing skills and knowledge in small sessions with each other. We're working toward a consistent workshop schedule, and right now, that looks like a weekly 2:30pm 'tea time' in the conference room. This week, Partner and Creative Director [Jennifer Masi](http://torque.digital/team/jennifer-masi) gave us tips and tricks about *The Art of Delegating*, also known by her actionable phrase, "Delegate to Elevate." 

I want to share her knowledge with you because I believe it's really important, and it's something I really need to learn myself. I know too many people who tend to work alone in a void. If we work alone, we may let strong skills for teamwork, collaboration, and trust for others atrophy. These traits provide a necessary foundation for delegation. It can be scary to invite someone else in to your creative process, but your work – *and sanity* – may suffer if you always do it alone. 

### Goals of Delegation
Delegating helps elevate you to your best use and elevates helpers as they learn and grow. Delegating helps you learn to trust others, gets the job done well, and diversifies perspectives going into the project.


### Ask yourself, Is this a delegation moment?
Just because a task is assigned to you, doesn’t mean you need to be the one to complete it. It can always be delegated. Can you delegate anything on your plate right now?
Important to note:

> No job is beneath anyone. All jobs are important. Leaders know how and are willing to do all the jobs. Remember, if someone doesn’t buy the toilet paper, *what would happen to the office?*


### Keys to Delegate like a Pro 
1. **Give time frame & details.** Be specific about the details of the project to set a strong foundation and make sure everyone is on the same page.

2. **Delegate the objective, not the procedure.** This is where trust comes in. Successful delegation respects the opinion and process of everyone involved. Delegating projects or tasks comes with understanding that different people have different ways of doing the same thing. Dictating every facet of a project is strangling when it could be thriving on the contributions of others.

3. **Ensure your helper has whatever they need to succeed.** Equip your helpers with the right tools so they can do their best work for your project. Check in with them to make sure their tools are working for them.

4. **Give your helper the opportunity to ask questions.** Setting aside time for questions and conversations about the project will give your helper a feeling of ownership and involvement in the project. Strong communication with people to whom you delegate is investing in the quality of the end product.

5. **Check in with helper until project completion.** Gotta stay on task! Follow up and check in with everyone on the project. Touching base more often makes sure the project doesn't go off track so you can acheive the outcome you need.

6. **Show your appreciation for the people who invested in your project with you.** A big 'thank you' goes a long way. I know I'm personally guilty of not always going the extra step to vocalize my thankfulness. Showing gratitude increases personal growth on both sides and better partnerships going forward.
