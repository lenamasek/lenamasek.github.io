Over the past year at [Torque](http://torque.digital), we've been sharing skills and knowledge with each other in small, periodical workshops. These days, that looks like a weekly 2:30pm 'tea time' in the conference room. For this week's workshop, Partner and Creative Director [Jennifer Masi](http://torque.digital/team/jennifer-masi) gave us tips and tricks about *The Art of Delegating*, also known by her actionable phrase, "Delegate to Elevate." 

I'm morphing her presentation into a post so I can share it with you because I believe it's really important, and it's something I need to learn myself. Many people I know work alone – sometimes literally alone, other times they're not working collaboratively with their teammates. I am definitely guilty of this. If we work alone, we may let strong skills for teamwork, collaboration, and trust for others atrophy. We need these traits to provide a necessary foundation for delegation, and we need the practice of delegation to strengthen those traits in us. It can be scary to invite someone else in to your creative process, but your work – *and sanity* – may suffer if you always do it alone. 



### Goals of Delegation
Delegating helps elevate you to your best use and elevates helpers as they learn and grow. Delegating helps you learn to trust others, gets the job done well, and diversifies perspectives going into the project.



### Ask yourself, is this a delegation moment?
Just because a task is assigned to you, doesn’t mean you need to be the one to complete it – it can often be delegated. Delegation is also not a status indicator. Jennifer makes an important note:

> No job is beneath anyone. All jobs are important. Leaders know how and are willing to do all the jobs. Remember, if someone doesn’t buy the toilet paper, *what would happen to the office?*



### Keys to Delegate like a Pro 
1. **Give time frame & details.** Be specific about the details of the project to set a strong foundation and make sure everyone is on the same page. Establishing a clear, shared idea about the outcome of the project will ensure its success.

2. **Delegate the objective, not the procedure.** This is where trust comes in heavily. Successful delegation respects the opinion and process of everyone involved. Delegating projects or tasks comes with understanding that different people have different ways of doing the same thing. Dictating every facet of a project strangles it; let the project thrive on the contributions of others.

3. **Ensure your delegatee has whatever they need to be successful.** Equip everyone helping you with the right tools so they can do their best work for your project. Check in with them periodically to make sure their tools are working well for them.

4. **Give your delegatee the opportunity to ask questions.** Setting aside time for questions and conversations about the project will give your helpers a feeling of ownership and involvement in the project. Strong communication with people to whom you delegate is investing in the quality of the end product.

5. **Check in through project completion.** Gotta stay on task! Follow up and check in with everyone on the project. Touching base more often makes sure the project doesn't go off track so you can acheive the outcome you need. Make sure they confirm with you when their tasks are finished and follow up after the project.

6. **Show your appreciation for the people who invested in your project with you.** A big 'thank you' goes a long way. I know I don't always go the extra step to vocalize my thankfulness. Showing gratitude increases personal growth on both sides and better partnerships going forward.
