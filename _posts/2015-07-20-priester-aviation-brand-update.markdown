[Priester Aviation](http://priesterav.com), a multi-disciplinary aviation service company, needed screens designed for their new app. Priester manages, flies, and cares for private planes, and this app works to help the owners of those planes manage the services they need to schedule.

To continue with a long term rebranding project, we designed business cards, a 20-page brochure, a cover for a spiral-bound brochure on Priester's Aircraft Management, and two corporate folders. Being the lead designer on multiple projects for the same client across a variety of mediums was a great experience in brand design and consistency.
