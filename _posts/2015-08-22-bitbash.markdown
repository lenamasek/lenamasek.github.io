[Bit Bash](http://bitbashchicago.com) is Chicago's first alternative games festival. In early 2014, a few Chicagoans traveled to the annual Game Developers' Conference in the Bay Area, had a blast, and lamented about how Chicago doesn't have any large events (festivals, conferences) for the games industry. They were tired of travelling to the coasts for games events, so they gathered friends and began to plan Chicago's first games festival.

Bit Bash started to take shape in the spring of 2014 as the mission and goals were being fleshed out between the co-organizers. [Jamie Sanchez](http://jamiesanchez.com) invited me along to help with design and marketing. 

As a team, we decided that we wanted to make diverse games accessible to diverse people. We wanted to make games available that weren't playable at home, games that offered unique experiences, enjoyable by a large to unlimited amount of people, games created by a mix of developers from many different backgrounds.

**Co-Organizers:** *Jamie Sanchez, Ryan Wiemeyer, Rob Lach, Brice Puls, Tom Eastman, David Laskey, John Murphy, Rob Lockhart, Dana Trebella, Andy Saia*

**We also couldn't do it without:** *All our many, many volunteers, the game developers making really cool games, Threadless, Arcade Brewery, VGA Gallery, Dark Matter Coffee, Sony, Alienware, Chicago Loot Drop, Cards Against Humanity, SteelSeries, and many other sponsors & partners.*
