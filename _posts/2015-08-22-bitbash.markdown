[Bit Bash](http://bitbashchicago.com) is Chicago's first alternative games and arts festival. I am a co-organzier contributing with design, marketing, social media, and project managing.

### Origin  
In early 2014, a few Chicagoans traveled to the annual Game Developers' Conference in the Bay Area, had a blast, and lamented about how Chicago doesn't have any large events (festivals, conferences) for the games industry. In response, they gathered friends and began to plan Chicago's first games festival. [Jamie Sanchez](http://jamiesanchez.com) invited me along to help with design and marketing.

### The First Bit Bash  
Bit Bash started to take shape in the spring of 2014 as the mission and goals were being fleshed out between the co-organizers. As a team, we decided that we wanted to make diverse games accessible to diverse people. We wanted to make games available that weren't playable at home, games that offered unique experiences, enjoyable by a large to unlimited amount of people, games created by a mix of developers from many different backgrounds, telling many different stories. 

To be inclusive, we have been clear and upfront about our Code of Conduct with our organizers, volunteers, volunteer captains, and attendees. It is very important to us to create a safe space for any and every person to enjoy various art forms together, and our CoC helps lay that foundation.

### Features  
Co-organizers curated a long list of games that fit the criteria and contacted the developers. We also expanded the festival to include Art Bash, a poster showcase that allowed people to submit work that would eventually be printed with Risograph, if selected by a guest panel of judges, previously including [AIGA](http://chicago.aiga.org) and [VGA Gallery](http://videogameartgallery.com). We facilitated the printing and selling of the posters. All proceeds went back to the artists. 

Each event has had DJ sets in the evening, indoor and outdoor games, and special hardware games. Bit Bash 2015 featured a tabletop sit down area by [Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/).

### Teams  
Planning our first Bit Bash helped us realize where each of our strengths are and where we most successfully fit in contributing to the project. For 2015, we formed loose teams to organize ourselves and establish some hierarchy. The teams were marketing, logistics, curation, and operations/admin.

### My Contribution
My role began as design support, including creating the logo, brainstorming each event's theme, conceptually exploring the visual design for each theme, designing the t-shirt and other branded materials for each event, and assisting Jamie in laying out a cohesive brand style as it evolves along with us. For Bit Bash 2015, I was sorted into the marketing team and casually picked up the role of social media manager. I will likely move into more of a project manager role as we move forward.
