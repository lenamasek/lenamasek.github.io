## History 
A few months ago, [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/sgosztyla), a video and mobile game developer in Chicago, tweeted at a few web designers/developers, asking if there was a [Slack](http://slack.com) set up for Chicago web people to talk and share knowledge, and if so, could he join? I'm glad he asked, because there wasn't a central meeting/chatting platform set up at the time, but [now there is](http://chicagofriends.website), set up by [Savannah](http://sava.nnah.rocks) *(she has the best url by the way).*

So many great tips/links/info/knowledge/jokes/memes are shared daily in that Slack, which is now a gathering place for almost 60 people of many different backgrounds and experiences with the web. Some folks are senior back-end web developers, some are entry level front-end developers, some are designers (of many kinds) looking to get more comfortable with web, and some are corporate IT managers.

I'll probably share more about the wealth of information shared in this Slack in future posts, but one topic a few months ago is something I've been wanting to share for awhile. [Erick De La Rosa](http://twitter.com/eeedlr) asked the group about tools to learn JQuery/Javascript, which yielded many great responses that come from lots of experience.

Erick mentioned that he completed relevant courses on CodeAcademy, but he brings up a good point: 

> Once you leave the virtual classroom, how do you apply that knowledge to an actual product? 

David Laskey (@david_laskey) pointed out that *"sites like CodeAcademy reward you for a Simon Says-like progression that give you a false sense of actually learning the material."* Thereâ€™s definitely a gap between digesting and regurgitating information to pass a level and learning material enough to be able to use it practically going forward.
