Learning can be difficult, especially if we don't know how to learn. To a point, knowing how to learn comes naturally, but there are a lot of tools for retention and growth that teachers in school never taught us. Many students learn to memorize, not to retain and put into real life practice what they "learned." When trying to learn new things as an adult, we face these issues again. I've been finding that we need to learn how to actually learn new things.

### Slack: A Place for Learning
A few months ago, in a [Chicago Web Friends Slack](http://chicagofriends.website) – a group for Chicago web designers, developers, and anyone interested in the web to talk and share knowledge – [Erick De La Rosa](http://twitter.com/eeedlr) asked about tools to learn JQuery/Javascript, which yielded many great responses that come from lots of experience.

Erick mentioned that he completed relevant courses on CodeAcademy, but he brings up a good point: 

> Once you leave the virtual classroom, how do you apply that knowledge to an actual product? 

[David Laskey](http://twitter.com/david_laskey) pointed out that *"sites like CodeAcademy reward you for a Simon Says-like progression that give you a false sense of actually learning the material."* There’s definitely a gap between digesting and regurgitating information to pass a level and learning material enough to be able to use it practically going forward. Here are some tips shared to make learning a new code language actually stick:


### How to REALLY Learn a New Code Language

+ **Try making something small** Give yourself a small thing to make and see it through. The language will stick a lot more than just reading about it. [Kunal](http://twitter.com/kunalbhat) makes a simple Lorem Ipsum generator to start learning each new language. Check out his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kunalbhat?tab=repositories) for those project and others. There’s no substitute for doing something simple over and over again to drive home your knowledge; small projects are a great way to do that.

+ **Break down the problem** Write out instructions as you learn. Organize your thoughts into: “How would I accomplish this task in code?” and then “What is the actual syntax and helper functions I need to remember to do this?” Try doing the first part without the documentation info available and then open them up for the second part. The language is really just a vehicle for accomplishing the components to a problem. Become aware of the types of things you’re able to do in that language.


+ **Find the right project.** Something that is both visually interesting to keep your attention, but not too complicated where you feel overwhelmed.





### Chicago Web Friends Slack
A few months ago, [Savannah](http://sava.nnah.rocks) set up a [Chicago Web Friends Slack](http://chicagofriends.website) group for Chicago web designers, developers, and anyone interested to talk and share knowledge.So many great tips/links/info/knowledge/jokes/memes are shared daily in that Slack, which is now a gathering place for almost 60 people of many different backgrounds and experiences with the web and otherwise. Some folks are senior back-end web developers, some are entry level front-end developers, some are corporate IT managers, some are designers of various disciplines looking to get more comfortable with web. Our common denominators are only *Chicago, web,* and *friends.*
