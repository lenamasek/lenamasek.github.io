Learning can be difficult. There are a lot of factors to being able to actually learn something, including students' learning styles and teachers' styles and methods, to name a few. When we're out of organized school systems and trying to learn things on our own, maybe through a YouTube video or SkillShare class, it can be hard to recreate the structure of learning and actually retain practical information. We find that we need to learn how to actually learn new things.

### History 
A few months ago, [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/sgosztyla), a video and mobile game developer in Chicago, tweeted at a few web designers/developers, asking if there was a [Slack](http://slack.com) set up for Chicago web people to talk and share knowledge, and if so, could he join? I'm glad he asked, because there wasn't a central meeting/chatting platform set up at the time, but [now there is](http://chicagofriends.website), set up by [Savannah](http://sava.nnah.rocks) *(she has the best url by the way).*

So many great tips/links/info/knowledge/jokes/memes are shared daily in that Slack, which is now a gathering place for almost 60 people of many different backgrounds and experiences with the web. Some folks are senior back-end web developers, some are entry level front-end developers, some are designers (of many kinds) looking to get more comfortable with web, and some are corporate IT managers.

I'll probably share more about the wealth of information shared in this Slack in future posts, but one topic a few months ago is something I've been wanting to share for awhile. [Erick De La Rosa](http://twitter.com/eeedlr) asked the group about tools to learn JQuery/Javascript, which yielded many great responses that come from lots of experience.

Erick mentioned that he completed relevant courses on CodeAcademy, but he brings up a good point: 

> Once you leave the virtual classroom, how do you apply that knowledge to an actual product? 

[David Laskey](http://twitter.com/david_laskey) pointed out that *"sites like CodeAcademy reward you for a Simon Says-like progression that give you a false sense of actually learning the material."* There’s definitely a gap between digesting and regurgitating information to pass a level and learning material enough to be able to use it practically going forward. Here are some tips shared to make learning a new code language actually stick:


### How to REALLY Learn a New Code Language

+ **Try making something small** Give yourself a small thing to make and see it through. The language will stick a lot more than just reading about it. [Kunal](http://twitter.com/kunalbhat) makes a simple Lorem Ipsum generator to start learning each new language. Check out his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kunalbhat?tab=repositories) for those project and others. There’s no substitute for doing something simple over and over again to drive home your knowledge; small projects are a great way to do that.

+ **Break down the problem** Write out instructions as you learn. Organize your thoughts into: “How would I accomplish this task in code?” and then “What is the actual syntax and helper functions I need to remember to do this?” Try doing the first part without the documentation info available and then open them up for the second part. The language is really just a vehicle for accomplishing the components to a problem. Become aware of the types of things you’re able to do in that language.


+ **Find the right project.** Something that is both visually interesting to keep your attention, but not too complicated where you feel overwhelmed.
