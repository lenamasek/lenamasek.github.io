I've wanted to use a tool like Jekyll for my personal site before I knew it existed. I wanted to automate my site just enough to make keeping up with a blog and portfolio easy and efficient without limiting or inhibiting my designs, making the upkeep of the site more difficult than necessary. 

I've built sites with Wordpress and worked with Drupal, but those robust CMSs are too powerful for my needs. Alternatively, Squarespace and other pre-designed portfolio sites, although helpful to many, became a hinderance to my ability to make my own design choices. 

After searching and tweeting for help, I found Jekyll, among other options, like [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/) and [Statamic](http://statamic.com/). A friend, [Savannah](http://sava.nnah.rocks), was using Statamic at the time, which is pretty similar to Jekyll, but with a very minimal back-end interface. I knew I didn't want to pay to use an interface, so I went with Jekyll. The perks that come with using a relatively well-known engine, meaning a good chance that you'd find a forum thread to help with questions, was enticing as well.

Soooo.. what *is* Jekyll? What are all these products, what do they do?

>Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator". - [JekyllBootstrap.com](http://jekyllbootstrap.com)

Jekyll allows me to use [Liquid Markdown templating language](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) to format pages and give the engine the information it needs to properly parse my files. A new post means duplicating a file, changing a few things in the [YAML Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), and uploading it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I've been somewhat avoiding writing this post because I don't know that I'm *done* learning or building with Jekyll. I don't know everything about how Jekyll works, yet. I've learned a lot so far, though, which is awesome.
