Learning can be difficult if we don't know how to do it. It can come naturally, but there are many tools for retention and growth that teachers in school never taught us. Many students learn to memorize information to regurgitate on a test, but not to retain and put into real life practice what they "learned." As we age, we continue to face these issues as adults. Isn industries where we need to learn constantly to stay current, how do we *really* learn?

### Slack: A Place for Learning
A few months ago, in a [Chicago Web Friends](http://chicagofriends.website) Slack group – a place for Chicago web designers, developers, and anyone interested in the web to talk and share knowledge – [Erick De La Rosa](http://twitter.com/eeedlr) asked about tools for learning JQuery/Javascript, which yielded many great responses that come from lots of experience.

Erick mentioned that he completed relevant courses on [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) in an effort to learn, but "it just hasn't seemed to stick yet." He asks an important question: 

> Once you leave the virtual classroom, how do you apply that knowledge to an actual product? 

 "Sites like Codecademy reward you for a Simon Says-like progression that give you a false sense of actually learning the material," [David](http://twitter.com/david_laskey) responds. There’s definitely a gap between digesting and regurgitating information to pass a level and learning material enough to be able to use it practically going forward. Here are some tips shared to make learning a new code language actually stick:


### Tips for Practical Learning

+ **Use quality tools.** For Erick's particular situation with Javascript, [Savannah](http://twitter.com/savannahmillion) suggests [try.jquery.com](http://try.jquery.com), because "the exercises are always similar to what you see in the video, but different enough to where you still have to think about them." [Kunal Bhat](http://twitter.com/kunalbhat) shares [CodeSchool's Javascript path](http://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript). Find tutorials and guides that will challenge you to apply your new knowledge in different ways – this will help your retention. 

+ **Try making something small** Give yourself a small thing to make and see it through. The language will stick a lot more when you put it into practice to make something you're proud of, rather than just reading about it. Find the right project that is both visually interesting to keep your attention, but not too complicated where you feel overwhelmed and avoid completing it.

+ **Break down the problem** Write out instructions as you learn. [Coleman Collins](http://twitter.com/COLEMANICEWATER) says that what helped him to learn JQ/JS was to "actually write out instructions or psuedo-code logic first." Organize your thoughts into: “How would I accomplish this task in code?” and then “What is the actual syntax and helper functions I need to remember to do this?” Try doing the first part without the documentation info available and then open them up for the second part. The language is really just a vehicle for accomplishing the components to a problem. Become aware of the types of things you’re able to do in that language to build your understanding of how it works.

+ **Practice it over and over.** Kunal "likes to use the same problem as a starter" to learning a new language. He's made a simple Lorem Ipsum generator in [Ruby](https://github.com/kunalbhat/morel-ipsum), [JS](https://github.com/kunalbhat/morel-ipsum-js), and [Python](https://github.com/kunalbhat/morel-ipsum-python). There’s no substitute for doing something simple over and over again to drive home your knowledge.

### More on the Chicago Web Friends Slack
A few months ago, game developer [Sebastian](http://twitter.com/sgosztyla) tweeted, asking if there was a place where Chicago people in web fields shared information/answered questions, as there is an equivalent for Chicago game developers. There wasn't, so Savannah set up a Chicago Web Friends group through [Slack](http://slack.com) for Chicago web designers, developers, and anyone interested to talk and share knowledge. It is now a gathering place for almost 60 people of many different backgrounds and experiences with the web and otherwise. Some folks are senior back-end web developers, some are entry level front-end developers, some are corporate IT managers, some are designers of various disciplines looking to get more comfortable with web. If you have information to share or questions to ask, you should [definitely jump in](http://chicagofriends.website)! The only rule is: don't be a jerk.
