[The Truth About You and Me](http://thetruthaboutyouand.me) is a social project that reminds people of the truth about who they are, with messages including, "you are loved," "your worth is inherent," and "you are perfectly adequate." It is as much a reminder for myself as it is a gift from me to others.

The idea came to me during a brunch hangout with [James T. Green](http://jamestgreen.com). I went straight home to my desk to build and design the site in about five hours. The content took a lot longer; I wrote more than twenty messages over many months because I wanted the truths to come from my experience, from a deep place within me. I knew it would be difficult to write copy for universal truths since there are so many different human experiences.

I have a strong belief that everyone needs unconditional love. That kind of love is uncommon and very difficult, but hugely beneficial. I wanted to use this site as a tool to extend my love to others and to help others love themselves. I wanted to be as inclusive as possible and was very nervous to launch the site publicly for fear of accidentally doing the opposite.

The design of [The Truth](http://thetruthaboutyouand.me) is characterized by bright, happy colors and thin, lowercase, clean, unassuming type. I wanted the design to echo the (attempt at) inclusivity of the writing and subconsiously bring happiness and calmness. Several people wrote to me with their stories of struggling with one of the truth messages and how the reminder was helpful. I'm grateful that the site can connect with more people on a deeper level than I'd be able to reach.

In 2016, I finally put the project on Github, and you can view it [here](https://github.com/lenamasek/thetruth).
