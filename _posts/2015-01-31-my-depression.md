FWIW, I don’t know if what I have *is* depression or – I don’t know. I haven’t been to a therapist because I’m scared of accepting it. I’ve always referred to my struggles as “being in a rut” because I don’t want to claim the title of depression when it hasn’t been diagnosed.


**Why I Don’t Want to Accept Depression or See a Therapist**

I was raised to be tough, to not believe everything I hear, to be smart and critical and analytical. My family doesn’t go to the doctor, they take medicine if they’re sick and they don’t miss work or class. Whatever struggles my family deals with are not allowed to affect others – the show must go on. 

Also, I’ve definitely been in ruts before and they do get better because I’m able to work myself out of them. So why is this any different? How can I tell if it’s worse? Do I just need attention or validation? I really don’t know. What I do know is that this blog is an attempt of self-therapy so I don’t have to talk to A Person™ about this.

I’ve known that I struggle with “ruts” for years and years now. I’ve always been like this. I’ve wanted and came very close to seeing a therapist several times in the past. Each time, knowing that I had a way out of my “rut,” helped me see the light at the end of the tunnel and kind of hobble through it on my own. The idea of admitting depression and seeing a therapist felt like a get out of jail free card that helped me not feel so trapped and alone, giving me the boost I needed to continue to do it on my own. I’m realizing now, that boost may have just been adopting a new defense mechanism, such as getting used to the struggle and accepting it as part of myself, therefore making it not a problem that needed to be sorted out. I’m just learning a new piece of myself, I’m rationalizing it. We all have our stuff, right? This is my stuff. I can handle myself. 


Realizing the Problem

I started realizing it may be a legitimate problem only recently. The first red flag was when I read an article about defense mechanisms and realized how many of them are habitual for me:

* Displacement (taking your frustration out on something that isn’t the source of the frustration)
* Intellectualization (staying distant and avoiding emotions and stress by thinking about a situation intellectually/rationally/logically)
* Rationalization (explaining an unacceptable behavior or feeling in a rational or logical manner, avoiding the true reasons for the behavior)
* I thought doing away with feelings and emotions and conditioning myself to see things logically was making me a smarter and better person. I was telling lots of people about it. I worked hard at it, and I successfully numbed myself to a lot of stuff. I didn’t cry at or about anything, I didn’t get overly excited, I stayed pretty even keel and I thought I was cool for it. When I did have unavoidable emotions, they made me angry. I wasn’t handling it well enough; I was failing.

The intellectualization mechanism is also a large part of my internalized misogyny, but that’s for another blog post.

The second red flag has been a long time coming: I’m angry, so often.


The Incredible Hulk is someone to whom I feel like I can relate. Not because I terrorize and wreck things, but because that’s how I feel inside. Always ready to be angry about something, but WHY. Seriously, this gets in the way of my performance at work, in the way of my relationships whether family, friends, or romantic. It gets in the way of my peace of mind, my decision making, my functionality. This anger needs to stop! I’m ANGRY that I’m ANGRY! What the hell?! I was sitting with those questions for weeks, and during that time, I had dinner with a friend. I wanted to get to know her better, and while talking about ourselves and sharing our stories and passions, I finally heard everything I was saying about myself. I knew those things about myself, obviously because I was sharing them, but I didn’t internalize or process them? It’s a very weird reality. I heard myself tell her how much I hated myself, how much I think poorly of myself and my efforts, how much I assume everyone hates me though I know they actually don’t (probably). 

This dinner conversation was the third red flag, the third strike. If I’m always in defense mode, if I’m always angry, if I hate myself, MAYBE I’M DEPRESSED. It’s gotta be something, if not that. I can’t live like this, and something this deep is not easy to get out of on my own. It’s like a disgusting vat of cartoon quicksand. 



**My Experience**

The basis of this is that there is Something Else in my head that speaks to me abusively. It’s an irrational, angry, rude voice that hates me and wants the worst for me.

I’m going to list some things that the Something Else voice has told me over the years, but you don’t have to read them. I just need to get them out so they don’t stay trapped in my head where they can hurt me. 

* I’m so, so stupid
* All my confidence is a series of lies I’m telling myself to get through the day
* I will never be as cool as my peers
* I’ll get better at things but I’ll always be behind everyone else
* I’m a child that shouldn’t be listened to
* I let everyone down, all the time
* i’m annoying as all get out
* I’m TOLERATED, not WANTED
* I’m invited to things by association, not because anyone likes me
* Everyone talks about me and all the stupid things I do in public
* My work SUCKS
* When people pay me for my work, they resent it
* I’m not worth the money I make
* My websites break and everyone hates them and thinks they’re ugly
* I masquerade as a legitimate adult but I’m not
* My bosses are going to regret hiring me if they don’t already
* I go to church and try to love people unconditionally, but I fail ridiculously all the time
* I’ll never be able to show anyone that people who believe in Jesus are not ignorant, traditional, right-winged, close-minded, self-seeking, and anti-social justice because I’m a terrible person
* I suck so bad at loving people and my life doesn’t look any different than the next consumerist, urban 20-something
* If I ever tell anyone I believe in Jesus, they’ll hate me
* If I ever tell anyone I believe in Jesus and end up hurting them somehow, they’ll hate Jesus even more and * I’ll be a disappointment to everyone
being honest in this blog post will end my friendships
many more, I’m sure, but I’m starting to cry
* In the past, I’ve been sad and melancholy for awhile in my rut. I’ve lost interest in things, slowed down, slept a lot, etc. This time, it’s a true beast I’m fighting. It’s not just sadness, it’s worthlessness. On top of all the negative messages I listed, the Voice also tells me that I must have a lot of time on my hands to be so wrapped up in my precious little white girl ~ FEELINGS ~. I must think I’m SOOOO SPECIAL to be so glamorously “depressed.”

Cool move, self.

The Voice is a really efficient and all-encompassing villain. It makes me feel bad and then makes me feel bad about feeling bad, so I never reach out for help. Always keeps me coming back for more and beats me up each time. 


**The Resolve, At Least I Hope So**

It’s no wonder that I built up a fortress of defense mechanisms - this stuff is really painful. Some part of my brain knew I didn’t want to deal with my problems before the rest of me got around to realizing they were even there.

I cry relatively frequently now. I went from being known for hardly ever tearing up to crying on my boyfriend’s shirt when we’re supposed to be on a fun date. And I mean, if you felt like someone was shouting at you about how much everyone around hates you, I have a feeling you’d cry too. 

I can’t afford to control these feelings anymore. I’ve got to confront them, sit with them, and work through them. There may be a lot more to unpack than what I’ve talked about here, I may see a therapist, I may write more blog posts to process it all, but I’ll get there. Writing this post helped me feel a lot better/more capable to handle this stuff already. 

There’s hope, I know it.
