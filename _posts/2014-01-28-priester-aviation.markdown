[Priester Aviation](http://priesterav.com), a multi-disciplinary aviation service company, needed screens designed for their new app. Priester manages, flies, and cares for private planes, and this app works to help the owners of those planes manage the services they need to schedule.

Priester contracted a mobile app company to develop the app and Torque to design the screens. We started by designing the screens that we were told were needed by conversations between the client and the developers. We soon realized that the lack of structure and organization of the screens meant the users' experience had a lot of holes, so we pitched a better UX structure.

After many long phone conferences and a large growth in project scope, we were able to explain the need to fill the missing pieces of the app and design more screens to fit the new structure.

Through this project, everyone involved learned the importance of considering UI/UX design on a base level alongside development. Simultaneous progress in design and developement helps designers work within development limits, helps developers create the most user-friendly and efficient experience, and helps the everyone stay informed of the project's scope every step of the way.

To continue with a long term rebranding project, we designed business cards, a 20-page brochure, a cover for a spiral-bound brochure on Priester's Aircraft Management, and two corporate folders. Being the lead designer on multiple projects for the same client across a variety of mediums was a great experience in brand design and consistency.
