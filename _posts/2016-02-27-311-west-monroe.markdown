[311 West Monroe](http://311wmonroe.com) is building near the corner of Franklin and Monroe on the west side of Chicago's loop. The leasing agents at [Glenstar Properties](http://glenstar.com/) hired us at [Torque](http://torque.digital) to create a full marketing campaign to lease the building, including direct mail, email, and this website. Torque was also able to design and creative direct a sales center space in the building.

William contacted me in the spring of 2015 to design a website for the rebranding of Manifold Garden, known at the time as Relativity. He shared some of his sketches and a few sites as inspiration, including [FireWatch](http://firewatchgame.com) by Campo Santo and [Alto's Adventure](http://altosadventure.com) by Snowman. We worked well together to come up with a design for the site.
