This post is for anyone who may feel targeted by the goofy "Should Designers Learn to Code?" thinkpieces. Long story short, my advice is to build whatever career works for you. 

I knew I wanted to design since junior high or high school. I think I saw a poster somewhere and it must've stuck with me for awhile. I remember wanting to impact people indirectly, through design, like that poster did to me. It must not have been *too* effective because I no longer remember its content. I continued to take design to the internet and enrolled in a few web design classes in high school and college. Knowing HTML and CSS really helped me launch my Xanga blog, of which I was a co-owner and designer of really cool layouts (remember xX_hawtt_lyts_Xx ?? just kidding, I don't remember my Xanga handle either).

[Ben Ludwig](http://benludwig.com), while working at [Torque](http://torque.digital), found me through a portfolio site hosted by Columbia College. He offered me a web design internship in the spring of 2014, also known as the first time I was ever seen as primarily a web person. I soon began to fill gaps for the design team and, 6 months later, was hired on as a Digital Designer. I do believe that my ability to fulfill print and web design and development was a big part of being offered a full time position.

>Some designers totally hate coding. Some feel that expressing their creativity through code is what feels right for them. Designers should build their skillset to fulfill whatever role or field in which they're interested. Designers didn't ask for anyone's permission to make career choices.

At Torque, as a Digital Designer, I design for a large range of products: branding materials, mobile app screens, websites, direct mailers, emails, interior design graphics, packaging, point-of-sale displays, signage, and more. I also develop websites (front-end) and program emails. Since I've been there, I've been learning a lot of UI/UX and usability prinicples. My deep interest in psychology, sociology, cultural theory, and social justice fuels my design and development process and choices.

Here's my job description, as written by Ben, Torque's Senior Interactive Designer:

I've been concerned for some time that by splitting my time between print and digital design/development, I'm not growing or learning as quickly as I would be if all my time was focused on one or the other. It is great to design and learn from more than one approach, but I'm not growing at the speed I'm used to. Going forward, I'm working to supplement any training I may be missing during my day job with personal and freelance projects and finding opportunities to make my work at my job work for me. 

I hope you'll be able to find opportunities to make your circumstance work for you and your goals.
